## Her kommer planen

## STEG 1
+ Finn ut hva slags data vi har tilgjengelig

## STEG 2
+ Diskuter hva som m√• extractes

## Extract

### Retrieve the Data
- Identify the sources of data and define the retrieval mechanism for each source.
- Document the process of fetching data from APIs, databases, or other repositories.

### Data Processing
- Outline the steps involved in processing the raw data.
- Specify how and where the data will be stored before proceeding to the next stage.

### Data Exploration
- Conduct a qualitative analysis of the extracted data to understand its structure and content.
- Perform quantitative assessments to gather insights into the data's size, distribution, and key characteristics.

### Filtering and Retention
- Define criteria for filtering out irrelevant or redundant data.
- Clearly state what data will be retained and what will be discarded.

### Result Persistence
- Implement a strategy to write the results of API queries to a file for efficient future use.

## Transform

### Data Processing
- Describe the process of transforming data from the different sources.
- Evaluate the need for adapting the data model to facilitate later processing.

### Data Integration
- Address the challenge of dealing with data describing two distinct but related entities.
- Discuss how to merge the data in a meaningful way, considering the relationship between the two sources.

### Decision on Merging
- Analyze whether data merging should be done during the transformation phase or deferred to SQL queries during analysis.
- Document the rationale behind the chosen approach.

## Load

### Database Design
- Design the database structure, specifying the tables and relationships required to answer analytical questions.
- Consider normalization and other principles to optimize the database design.

### Data Loading
- Outline the process of loading the transformed data into the designed database.
- Address any considerations related to data integrity and consistency.
